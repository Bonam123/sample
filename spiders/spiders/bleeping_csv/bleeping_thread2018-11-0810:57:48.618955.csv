Hello everyone, I am new here. I am taking a Website design course at college and am using Notepad++ as my editor and to upload to my server.
Usually I don't have any problem with this, however, this time when trying to upload I click in the page to upload, hit the upload button and in the ""output"" box, (where I normally see my confirmation that it worked) I have an error that says ""553 Can't open that file: Permission denied"". What the heck is going on with this ""Bleeping Program/Computer""? LOL but seriously, my page is due to be viewed by my fellow classmates and I can't get it up, Help Please.
Tina

Hi,
My wife has a Kindle Fire HD 7 tablet. I would like to be able to send the screen image to our television. I know that there are streaming devices like the Fire Stick that let you show streaming content on the television, but that isn't what I'm looking for. What I want is to just send the video that is on the Fire screen to the television via some kind of wireless connection. This would allow my wife to surf the web, but use the larger screen of the television as a monitor.
If anyone has successfully been able to accomplish this task, please let me know how you did it.
Thanks.

You're quite welcome. I knew some of the Fire models did not support mirroring. And didn't want to waste your time giving you directions. Just to have you come back and say they didn't work. I figured best to verify if it could even be done from the start.

If it has wireless and it does , this should work or similar if you purchase one , i use a Western Digital Media Centre    http://www.cnet.com/au/products/western-digital-wd-tv-media-player-2014/    connected to my Panasonic 42"" TV
I use it on my Network and works fine on any Wireless Device , just tried on My Android HTC M7 via wireless , on the WDTV scan for Devices and select which device you want to connect to , then select Miracast from WDTV option and away you go. 
Anything you do on Android Phone or Tablet will be displayed on the TV in real time.
Yet if using Web Browser -  Data from Phone / Tablet may decrease your Quota limit , where as i use my ADSL Connection over WIFI for all devices when im home.

Thanks, I will look into this. I found the WD device on Amazon and one statement left me a little concerned. It states that it will work with any ""Miracast-enabled"" device. I opened the Users Guide on the Fire and did a search for Miracast, but no results were found. Also, you stated above that anything that you do on your Android Phone or Tablet will be displayed on the TV. The Kindle Fire uses a ""Fire OS"", not Android. Amazon seems to like to keep things proprietary which is a hassle for anyone that wants to work with other kinds of devices.
I'll try to find a Fire HD user forum and see if anyone there can confirm that this tablet will work with the WD device or whether there might be some other option.

Did Chromecast get Kindle mirroring with the 2016 update or is that just for the newer models you mentioned?
Also, what model TV does OP have? Most newer TV's have integrated computers in them that can stream Netflix,etc without having to streamcast from another device. This would also reduce the amount of local bandwidth used for the stream.

My HTC M7 has no association with Wireless Display { Miracast } Function , its only a part of the WDTV Media Unit - Under - Setup / Network Settings / Wireless Display { Miracast } .
But its used via WDTV Unit as the Function - to Display the HTC Screen or Photos etcs , or anything i do on the Phone.
I do although select ""Media Output"" in ""Settings"" from the Phone and that detects the WDTV as a ""Miracast Device"" 
Which i select on the Phone and then it connects.
The Kindle is also based on Android { Read below } so i dont think it would be an issue with the WDTV Media , but i wouldnt like to steer you into the wrong direction in case it doesnt work.
FROM WIKI  -  Amazon FireOS is an Android-based mobile operating system produced by Amazon for its Fire Phone and Kindle Fire range oftablets, and other content delivery devices like Fire TV0x3B the tablet versions of the Kindle e-readers are the Fire range. It is forked from Android.Fire OS primarily centers on content consumption, with a customized user interface and heavy ties to content available from Amazon's own storefronts and services.
While the Kindle Fire line has always used customized distributions of Android, particularly 2.3.3 (API level 10) (Kindle Fire) and 4.0.3 (API level 15) (Fire HD), Amazon only began referring to the distribution as Fire OS beginning with its third iteration of Kindle Fire tablets, which includes the Fire HD 2nd generation and Fire HDX models. Unlike previous Kindle Fire models, whose operating system is listed as being ""based on"" Android, the Fire HDX ""FireOS 3.0"" operating system is listed as being ""compatible with"" Android0x3B FireOS 3 is forked from Android 4.2.2, (API level 17).[10][11][12] In the Fire HD (3rd generation) and Fire HDX (2nd generation) tablets, Fire OS 4 is included that is forked from Android 4.4.2 (API level 19).[13][14] Fire OS 4.5.1 is based on Android 4.4.3.[15][16] Fire OS 5.0 is based on Android 5.0 (API level 22).[17]

Just some more info:If It Helps ?
FROM - http://www.notebookreview.com/feature/screen-casting-101-the-wired-and-wireless-ways-to-share-displays-2015-update/
Miracast comes standard on all devices running Windows 8.1, and Android mobile devices running Jelly Bean 4.2 or later  although having 4.2 installed on your older Android doesnt necessarily mean your device is capable of mirroring content. Miracast functionality is a built-in standard with all Android devices manufactured with 4.4 and later. Most late-model Intel computers and laptops are also Miracast enabled, often under the Intel WiDi certification. Amazons Fire OS is also supported by Miracast. The Wi-Fi Alliance website provides information on all products that support the standard.
And - Like Roku, Amazon's $100 Fire TV box and $40 Fire TV Stick now support Miracast for screen mirroring from Android devices running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher. Fire TV also mirrors the Amazon Fire Phone and Fire HDX tablets. Amazon does not mention support for Windows Phone devices. To start mirroring, press and hold the home button on the Fire TV remote, and select Mirroring. Then, pair your mobile device. The process for pairing an Android device is the same as for any other Miracast receiver.
With a Kindle Fire HDX, select Settings, then Display and Sounds. Next, choose Display Mirroring. Much like the Apple TV approach, the HDX tablet will then pair with the Fire TV box over your Wi-Fi network. Once the connection is made, any video and audio played on your tablet will be mirrored on your TV via the Fire TV box. Consequently, you can sling not only videos, but music and photos as well.

We have a Kindle Fire HD (not HDX). The user's guide specifically states that if Display Mirroring does not appear in the Display and Sounds menu, then the device is not capable of mirroring, and this option does not appear in our Fire.
I think that this issue will be resolved in a roundabout way. My wife has been wanting to get a larger HDTV and we were at Sam's Club this morning and found a Samsung television that is capable of surfing the internet. (According to the salesman, LG televisions also have this capability). It will even accept a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse via the USB port (or so the salesman said). So I think that it makes more sense to put the $100+ into the cost of the new TV. The existing 32"" model will make a great monitor in the computer room!

Might I suggest that you actually test the keyboard functionality before purchasing said TV. My neighbor got a 40 inch Samsung web enabled TV. The keyboard he wanted to use was limited to arrow key and enter key usability. Letters didn't work. It still brought up the onscreen keyboard and you used the arrow keys to navigate. Needless to say, the TV was returned. I never did find out what he ended up with if anything.

+1 Finding the model TV in a store somewhere and trying it out. Some TV's user interface are better then others. Mouse lag can be a big issue on a large screen.
Also, what does your wife need to use the screen for? Web browsing? Email? Work? If it has anything to do with banking or signing into a secure website, I would't trust the browsers most TV's have. I only suggested a TV with integrated CPU when I thought it was for video streaming. Using a TV as a PC replacement is something else.

Animal and Trikein,
Thanks for the suggestion on checking out the keyboard. The salesman told me that he uses the Logitech keyboard on his Samsung television at home, so I hope that he knows what he's talking about. However, since they did have this television on display and working, it would not be too difficult to take the keyboard in and try it out.
My wife plans to use the web function to watch internet programming. She enjoys a lot of Korean dramas and movies and many of these do not have Roku channels associated with them. Or she might want to look at things on eBay or Amazon. I never gave too much thought to the level of security on a web-enabled television, so I'm glad that you brought this up. We'll be sure to do any internet transaction like banking on the computer.
I'm going to read specs on any internet-enabled television that we plan to buy, as well as customer reviews.

So now, I am considering Chromecast with a purpose to routine screen projection from my tablet PC to wide screen monitor, but only if I can make sure my tablet PC will not losing battery power even with charging connection, I had two opposite opinions when I posted the question in Facebook group of related domain topic, so I figure I need to post the question to a more professional forum, so I post it here, thank you in advance for your attention.
Regards,
Ben

What power connector and power adapter are you using to charge? Sounds like it's a non-official replacement.

I am sorry, I misunderstood your question. I think you are asking if a HDMI>Micro USB adapter will charge the tablet. I think the answer is NO. There is some power that runs over HDMI, but it is much weaker then that power you can run over USB. About 1/10th. Plugging it in this way when the tablet is off may ""trickle"" charge it, but it would take a long time.http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/28575/could-hdmi-be-potentially-used-as-a-power-supply-alternative-for-smartphones This site explains it well:
The specification of the +5V charge is 50mA(according to wikipedia) This is even lower as USB before enumeration(100mA) Any device wouldn't be able to charge , or it will be very slow at 50mA (10x slower than normal USB port at full power, 500mA)
I don't think the HDMI connectors are specified for high currents in excess of 0.5A. Furthermore, the +5V is probably used in the monior to power some small circuits for identification of itself to the PC/television/etc. , even if it's turned off.

..How it make support for our business?...
From what little bit I've seen, IT constructs and maintains an infrastructure and interface.  Like a house's infrastructure - support-framework, plumbing, electrical, etc.  House's interface - washer, dryer, diswasher, bathroom & kitchen sinks, etc.  Poeple create load when using computers, printers, scanners, ethernet and wireless devices and so on.  Company's infrastructure if built sufficiently, maintained sufficiently, updated sufficiently - will successflly carry the load brought on by the daily business.  I mention all this because long long ago a network guru gave me some insight as what he does, how he does it, why he does it -- all to support the daily business intranet and internet load, along with providing technical support to the poeple working.
One quick example:  If IT properly sets up and maintains sufficient, well-thought-out anti-virus, anti-malware programs and processes, the endusers, the workers, may never see ""all that behind the walls,"" however, their possibility of getting a virus or malware is somewhat-to-greatly reduced ['cause it's impossible to entirely eliminate such without severely curtailing functionality].

The key phrase in RolandJS's post is ""well-thought-out"".
There are so many companies that view IT as an afterthought because IT doesn't ""make"" them money. The problem with that view is that most work in the current work environment depends on IT. If IT decisions are not planned IT can end up costing a company more money when they have to buy new equipment, change IT configurations, or replacement software than if they simply spent the money at the beginning.

Now this is one of truest statements I have ever read.  At least most of the companies around here.  Not as bad as it used to be, many have slowly learned the hard way.

They didn't provide one for WIndows 8 so I'd be surprised if they did for Windows 10. Assuming existing virtual machine progams (like Virtual Box and VMware Player) are compatible with Windows 10 you could always install a virtual machine yourself if you own a legit copy of Windows XP.

Yeah, you can. I'm not sure how you get a 1GB image in the first place, unless you mean 1MB. You have to scale down the quality, pixel dimensions, or both to get a smaller filesize.

Hello.A 1GB photo would be pretty large, so I'm thinking you mean 1MB. I downloaded a program, called Image Resize Powertoys (it's by Microsoft), to resize the pixel dimensions, and it is SUPER easy to use. Once it is installed, you just right click on the photo you want resized, and there should be an option that says ""resize photo"". Click on that, and then choose the dimensions you want the photo to be. Using that program, I am able to resize a 4.07MB photo that is 3648x2736 down to a 32.4KB photo that is 640x480 (of course, you can choose your own dimensions).http://download.microsoft.com/download/whistler/Install/2/WXP/EN-US/ImageResizerPowertoySetup.exeSo just click here to download that program.-Brandon

A large (e.g. A4) image scanned at high resolution can be that size. I think it's unlikely that plywoodviolin is asking how to reduce a 1MB file to 600KB.
If the original image is actually 1GB, reduction to under 1MB is a big ask.
Basically the size of a stored image can be reduced by lowering the resolution, or using higher compression. Either way will involve considerable loss of image quality to reduce the file size by this amount.
theplywoodviolin (may I call you tpv?), could you confirm the 1GB file size for us, and explain a little more detail of the image involved?
For example, if it is a high resolution scan, you can use photo editing software to resample to a lower resolution, but it could give a better result if it's possible to rescan the original using the lower resolution. What type of file is the original - e.g. TIF, RAW etc?
If the resolution is vital, maybe to allow the image to be enlarged greatly, then reducing it to a small file size will lose so much quality as to make it useless for the purpose. But if for example you just want to be able to email a small version of the image to someone as a sample, you could use the editing software to resample to, say, 10% of the resolution, reducing the size to around 10MB, then save it as a .JPG, setting the compression to get the final filesize you want.

If you have MS Office installed on your computer, it will also have a handy bunch of additional programs in a submenu called Microsoft Office Tools.
One of those programs, called Microsft Office Picture Manager, is an easy to use program which includes the ability to compress images.
I use it myself to quickly compress the pictures taken by my digital camera whenever I need to post copies of them on websites, as it very considerably saves on memory size without appearing to cause picture quality degradation.

Resizing the image, changing the extension, and reducing quality can help lower the file size, but I don't think you can go from 1 GB to 1 MB that easily. But you will definetely see a difference in the file size after these modifications.

IrfanView can easily ""resample"" an image to any desired pixel count.  I use it daily for that purpose.  I shoot full-frame DSLR (Nikon D600) at the ""fine"" resolution setting of 6016 x 4016 pixels, at 24 bit color depth (""16 million colors"").  The resulting JPEG files are about 12-13 MB in size, just too big to send as E-mail attachments (RAW files are much bigger, that's a whole 'nother story).  I routinely downsize the JPEGs to say 1600 x 1068 pixels, resulting in a file size of around 320-350 KB.  You can send quite a few of those attached to one e-mail message.  The difference in quality is essentially not noticeable on a computer screen (unless you have a large photo-specialty monitor).  Print production or publication is of course a different matter.  I never send out full-resolution pictures (until paid for, that is <G>).  Most E-mail servers seem to have a 10 MB limit for attachments to one message - so if you do need to share full-size image files, Dropbox works well.  I've learned, moreover, that even the glossy magazines often don't want to deal with photo files bigger than a megabyte or so.  A JPEG file 4512 x 3012 - that's 3/4 of the original linear dimensions - is only 1.16 MB in size, or about 1/10 of the original file size (the file sizes vary a bit depending on the distribution of colors in the image).  Note this is not cropping but ""resampling"" of the entire original image at 3/4 scale.  The magic of the compression algorithm is such that a 44% reduction in pixel count yields a 90% reduction in file size.  My magazine editors love it <G>.
You can do the same thing with Photoshop, of course, with more bells and whistles, but IrfanView is so quick and easy (and amazingly capable) that I find myself using that most of the time.  
Of course, never overwrite the original image file with a reduced-size copy.  To avoid that I always create a separate subfolder for the copies, AND distinguish them by adding letters to the end of the file name.  That way, even if I save them into the wrong folder by mistake, I don't overwrite anything.
Being a control freak, I avoid programs that re-size pictures automatically when you send them in E-mail.  It takes only seconds to resize images in IrfanView, and then I know exactly what I did and what the recipient is going to see.

I have 3 devices.  First I have an older Sony Streaming Box this is in fact the best out of the three.  You can find one on ebay for $35 these days.  The model number is smp-n200.  Sony updates the channels frequently.  It also has a USB port that you can copy movie files to a memory stick (mp4, mov) and watch them.
Number 2 is a google chomecast ($35) which is good for sending YouTube's to your TV, not much more
My TV is a Visio it has a usb port (mp4, mov) and has a few apps, Netflix , crackle
The only free apps are crackle, YouTube, snag films

Happy New Year Oyugi,
I'm not sure I understand your questions, but let's see if we can figure that out together.
do i need to use unique proxies and ports if i am using tor browser.
If you are using the https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.enTor Browser Bundle, you do not need to make any configuration changes to run Tor. You just start the Tor Browser Bundle. For step by step installation instructions, please click https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#windowshere.
Found a website that asks for a fee to give access to a private vpn to access internet, interestingly i have to use my isp sim in my usb modem for it to work,how is that possible?
Many VPN providers are subscription services so you may have to pay to use them. Please understand Tor and VPNs are not the same thing. When you use a VPN, you still need to have an Internet connection. So, if you are going to purchase a VPN solution and use it you still need your Internet connection (which I am guessing you get with the SIM in your USB Modem provided by your ISP).
is there a way to get internet access without having to purchase isp expensive packages.
You have to get your Internet from an ISP. Depending on where you live and what is available from local ISPs you can use Dial-Up, Broadband, Mobile Broadband, Wi-Max, or Satellite Internet.
finally please help me understand the role of vpn, free proxies and ports for internet connectivity.

Fully satisfied with the answers, from what i understand is that with a non isp proxy, internet speeds can significantly be increased as well as being able to remain anonymous from the isp. Regarding vpn, i thought it was an alternative to get free access to the internet because i would be redirected to a different server much like how Your Freedom apk on android works. Anyways thanks for the enlightment.

I'm glad I was able to help you find answers.
Generally, using a proxy will NOT give you increased Internet speeds.
Keep in mind that when you are using the Internet you have to go from your computer to the destination. Each stop in the path is called a ""hop"". The diagram below is only meant to convey a concept and is not a representation of a complete route from source to destination.
Your Computer -> USB Modem -> Cellular Tower -> Provider Hop -> Provider Hop -> Destination
There may be more than 2 ""Provider Hops"" and other hops that are owned by different companies as your request goes from your computer to the destination.
When you use a proxy your path gets longer.
Your Computer -> USB Modem -> Cellular Tower -> Provider Hop -> Provider Hop -> Proxy -> Destination
There may also be multiple hops after the proxy and before the destination. Because you are making the path from you to the destination longer, you will not normally have faster Internet speeds.
A VPN is not a free alternative to your Internet access. You can use a VPN that could either be paid or free which you setup on top of your Internet connection.
The android app still requires your phone to have a cellular signal for the VPN app to work. In that case the cellular signal is the Internet connection.

That isn't much to work with, specifically with multiple light sources. Is that the highest resolution image available? Do you have more frames? Different angles? 
Also, have you contacted the Police/Interpol? They might be able to pull other images from traffic and security cameras.

Police are rather adept at recovering license plate number from security cameras.
If anybody can help with this matter they must CONTACT POLICE IN ICELAND, NOT OP OR ANYBODY INVOLVED, THE POLICE.
The reason is that you don't know this person. They could easily be one of the suspects. You can't possibly know. If somebody wants to help, contact the Iceland police.

I have never tried it with animated GIFs, but Bulk Image Manager works beautifully on non-animated images.  Since it costs nothing, and takes only minutes to install, you could certainly try it with copies of a few of the GIFs you need to resize and see if it works.
See also:  http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/04/featured/5-best-bulk-image-resizer-batch-image-resize.html 
I have not used Fast Stone's resizer but I have Fast Stone Image Viewer (which is way more than just a viewer) as my default image handling program.

You got me really curious about this, and after Bulk Image Manager didn't work I did some more digging.
Download and install http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/Gifsicle.  In the folder where all your GIFs that need to be resized are located, create a folder named ""Resized.""  See also this page on https://davidwalsh.name/resize-animated-gifusing Gifsicle on the command line.
You would need to use the following command in a Command Prompt window after you've navigated to the folder that contains the GIFs you want to resize:  
for %F in (*.gif) do gifsicle --scale 0.75 -i %F > .\Resized\%F
That would, for each gif file in the folder, run the gifsicle program scaling the animated gif to 75% of its original size and place the end result in the Resized folder under the same name.  If you wanted to change the name slightly you could use "".\Resized\SM_%F"" in the for command instead of just reusing the original file name, then all the resized files would start with the characters ""SM_"".
When I have bulk file processing to do, and there doesn't exist a bulk file processor that runs from a dialog, then I either use Command Prompt directly if I've got a single line command like the for to do the grunt work, or create a batch file, but that's really unnecessary here.

You're quite welcome.
I don't like the way I phrased one thing in the above instructions.  What follows presumes you've already downloaded gifsicle and have unzipped it to a folder.  It doesn't install in the registry but is a stand-alone program.
First you open command prompt.  Then you navigate within command prompt to the folder with the files.  Then, if you haven't done so already using file explorer, you create the folder where you plan to place the resized animated GIFS.  Finally you run the for command.  If you placed gifsicle somewhere random you may need to specify the full path to it in the do part, e.g., C:\gifsicle-dir\gifsicle    The rest of the line following gifsicle would remain the same.

We got the new Samsung TV and as the salesperson told us, it works great with the Logitech keyboard. Since this is a good solution, I won't be needing the Kindle Fire to try to accomplish this.

One of the things that constantly gets me about these articles, which do give a lot of great advice, is the level of alarm about the possibility of someone connecting to your WiFi network after having had access to your home, e.g., the plumber example.
WiFi signals do not travel all that far, public WiFi is now virtually ubiquitous (virtually any Wendy's, McDonalds, Starbucks, many Wal-Marts, Lowes, and the list goes on and on and on) why one earth would anyone choose to expose themselves to the risks involved by having to quite literally park themselves outside your house (which for many of us would cause immediate notice) to get into your network.   There's just no reason to do this when you can get on to a very great many WiFi networks, and some of them with password protection but where the password is shared with the public and not changed (so traffic is encrypted), that are easily accessible in any community and on which it would be much more difficult to trace back use to any given individual.
Criminals, or at least the good ones, are not stupid.  The days of snagging your neighbor's WiFi signal (which I have done in times past) are well and truly dead.
One should check one's router or modem-router settings and lock down what you can.  A quick check with https://www.grc.com/intro.htmShields Up! at Gibson Research to see what's open and vulnerable on your router and computer is an excellent place to start.

Yep, I did know that!  Though I've not found it turned OFF on any Routers, though I don't look at that very often either.  Mine was ON, so that may help others with the latest Xfinity Equipment, or relatively latest Xfinity Equipment.

Just be aware that, in most cases, your router (including cheap ones) will be far faster than the service you get for upload/download from the vast majority of ISPs.   Also, for any given machine on any given network your throughput will be only as fast as the slowest component through which it has to pass.   I find it amusing when I see some people going out and buying these super-duper ultra high speed gaming routers when they've got machines with Wireless G cards or single band N150 cards believing that they're going to get increased throughput.

First time poster so bare with me please.
I just upgraded my motherboard, cpu and memory. The first week it ran like a top on the windows 10 load from my previous build. Then after a week I decided to rearrange my storage and do a fresh install of windows 10 home. Ever since then I have experienced many random hang ups and freezes. Sometimes it will be 10 seconds of lag and then all keystrokes and movements entered will come back. Sometimes longer and sometimes a reset it needed. My temps seem ok , never seen anything above 55c. This can happen during easy tasks such as opening a browser. Seems to hate chrome. I am no pro by any means but can usually sort these things out on my own. I have many builds under my belt but am more of a hardware then software guy. Since the issue started after a week from the build and after a fresh windows install I am leaning towards a software issue? I believe all drivers are up to date. 
Specs are 
Asus strix rog 470 gaming MB 
AMD Ryzen 2600x
Gskill Ripjaw ddr4 3000
Geforce 960 4 GB (video card from old build)
Evga 600 watt power supply (pretty sure its evga I am at work and will double check) also from old build 
Boot drive is inland 240 GB ssd
Also a 500 GB Hdd and samsung evo 50p GB ssd.
I can gather more hardware specs when I get home but am stumped. Anyone have issues with a similar build?
Edit. Could be a hardware issue and I am not making the correct software changes or settings? Figured since I installed new hardware this would be the best board to post on. I can post on the software board if needed. 
I have checked and changed the memory frequency to 3000 mhz, swapped memory slots from 1 and 3 to 2 and 4 as I missed that those are Asus preferred for dual channel, another fresh instal of windows 10 home. 
I am sorry as I posted this originally in Hardware and see that maybe I should have posted in the Windows 10 board first. I am new to the forum.

They will always install but when computer reboots to install them it stops at 15% and then it tells me it is reinverting back to previous.
I did the Scan as Admin in Command Prompt and have included the CBS log.
I would really like to fix this without having to reinstall windows.
Thanks..I know a lot of people had had the issues with this update but haven't found anything that works.  I tried to add the CBS.log but it won't add it.
I was told by a friend to open CBS.Log with text and look for can't repair

I am looking at the files uploaded on the post before your last one
I attached them here as well again.
I did the Steps posted from doing WUReset, SURT Tool ( Which installed fine no errors), and then I did a CleanBoot by disabling all Services and Then disabling all Startup Programs with MsConfig.
::UPDATE::
Yay It worked...The only thing I noticed it didn't do is restart automatically when it updated.  I had to manually say search for windows updates...Then I manually had to Download and Install them.  I did turn off install updates automatically when all this issues kept happening where it would update automatically like it is set to do by default and then it would come up with a popup box saying Restart computer now to install updates and there would be a popup box that let me postpone it for 10minutes up to 4 hours.
Should I keep on Automatically install updates?
I also was able to free up more disk space on my C Drive from 22GBs of Free space to 45GB free space now.
I just want to say Thank you for being patient and answering my questions in a timely manner.  It is highly appreciated.

That is good news. You are welcome. Did you need anything else.
Should I keep on Automatically install updates?
It is your choice but for most users it is recommended. If not then you you should check for updates periodically.

Hey all. I've been having some BSOD issues lately while trying to stream. The BSOD is always the same error caused by the same driver, ""DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"". The driver in question is l1c63x64.sys. It is the Qualcomm Atheros Ar81xx series PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller. This BSOD does not happen when I am not streaming.
According to WhoCrashed:
Bug check description: This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high. This bug check belongs to the crash dump test that you have performed with WhoCrashed or other software. It means that a crash dump file was properly written out. A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: l1c63x64.sys (Qualcomm Atheros Ar81xx series PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller, Qualcomm Atheros Co., Ltd.).
Additionally, I am having problems with another driver, and this one seems to cause problems when I'm not streaming and don't even have OBS open. Same error: ""DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"". The second driver is cmudaxp.sys which belongs to C-Media Audio WDM Driver.
On further inspection, I have no idea what the C-Media Audio Driver even is for. I can't find it in my Device Manager, and I cannot find any drivers for it when I look in my uninstall list. The audio and sound controllers I have are: ASUS Xonar DG, Game Capture HD, NVIDIA High Definition Audio, NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible) (WDM), and VIA HD Audio.
For both of these drivers, I followed WhoCrashed's instructions and tried to look for driver updates. I could not in both places. The problem is Atheros does not have a working website anymore. What's more, I believe I do have the latest driver version. I had a backup driver saved on my PC several years ago but the filename was updated since then so I believe it's outdated. (l1c62x64.sys -> l1c63x64.sys). As for the C-Media driver, I believed through Google search that it was my ASUS Xonar DG hardware's driver. I uninstalled and re-installed that, but this BSOD persists. These BSOD's just happen randomly, usually when I try to open/close a program.
Specs and info are as follows:
Windows 10 x64 v.1803
OBS Version: 22.0.1 (64-bit)
Processor: INTEL I5-3570K 3.4 GHZ
Hard Drive: WD 2 TB CAVIAR BLACK SATA III 6.0 GB/ 7200 RPM
RAM: 2x 4GB CORSAIR VENGEANCE 1600MHZ DDR3
Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-Z77-D3H CROSSFIRE SATA 3 USB 3 LGA 1155
Sound Card: ASUS XONAR DG 5.1 CHANNELS PCI XONAR DG
Graphics: NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX1050 2GB
Power Supply: CORSAIR CMPSU-750TX V2
I have also included the SysnativeFileCollection ZIP as requested. I will be happy to provide any other info needed.
Thank you very much in advance for any help.

As you mentioned the most likely causes are the l1c63x64.sys and cmudaxp.sys drivers. Update the following drivers below and test. You also have several other third party drivers that may need to be updated to prevent future issues. Please create a Restore point before updating drivers.
Please update the  l1c63x64.sys (AR5BWB222) wifi driver from the link below:

Thanks so much for the assistance! I do have a couple of questions, however.
So far, I've installed the AR5BWB222 driver update via the Device Manager. However, that does not appear to affect the Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Ethernet Controller. It's an update for the Atheros AR5BWB222 Wireless Network Adapter. What's more, the update files did not include anything similar in name to l1c63x64.sys (which still exists in C:\Windows\System32\drivers).
Additionally, I seem to be having a problem with the C-Media driver update. I downloaded both the Win7 and Win10 versions of the CMI8788 driver. Both of the executable files would not open, with the message 'Don't support this platform.' It did originally open with nothing more than the option to 'Remove' in the installer shield. It first seemed to uninstall my ASUS Xonar DG driver. I did that and then restarted with only the option to 'Remove' remaining still. After about 3 cycles of using 'Remove'/restart, it finally popped up the message 'Don't support this platform.' the next time I tried to open it. I then had to reinstall the ASUS Xonar DG driver.
So, it seems I haven't made any progress on either of those drivers and am left pretty confused now.

Is the following the driver you tried to update. This is only for your Atheros AR5BWB222 WiFi adapter? Did you make sure to remove the old drivers first before updating? Also did you update the other third party drivers. I also recommend removing MBAM and SuperAntispyware at least while troubleshooting.
Try the following drivers: If you cannot find a good driver for the Sound card is it needed since you have the GTX 1050. If not, I would remove it to prevent issues.

I neglected to look at the top of the Atheros drivers website and found the 'Network Drivers' tab which indeed did have an update for my AR8151. But now we move into where my knowledge of PC's is tasked.
So, if I'm correct, the way to remove old drivers would be via Device Manager. However, the update files I have here are .sys files and from what I've gathered, you need to right-click the device in the Device Manager in order to apply the drivers to it. If the device is uninstalled via Device Manager, how would I be able to bring it back in order to apply said drivers? I did, at the very least for now, use the Update Driver function on the AR8151 to apply the new driver from the website.
Also, I went digging through one of the C-Media driver ZIPs that I downloaded and found a folder that indeed has a cmudaxp.sys. As stated before, though, I cannot find anything pertaining to C-Media in my Device Manager and I certainly do not want to try to apply a driver to an incorrect device. Confusingly, the folder also has a cmudaxp64.sys, which I would imagine my PC would want instead because it is x64? I'm unsure of what to do with these drivers.

The driver you need to update is for your WiFi AR5BNFA222 adapter which is what is listed in the BSOD as the most likely cause.
Go to the following link and scroll down until you find AR5BNFA222

This is the direct link if it works.

Here is a guide on how to install INF drivers: Do NOT install Drivereasy.
https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/2-ways-to-install-a-driver-with-no-executable-exe-file/
As I mentioned above only use the following driver for your Asus Sound card (C-Media cmudaxp.sys driver)
After performing the following updates test and see if your issue are resolved.

But wait. The BSOD didn't list the AR5BNFA222 as the most likely cause -- it listed the AR8151 as the cause. l1c63x64.sys is the driver for the AR8151, not the AR5BNFA222.

Both were indeed updated. Unfortunately there's no way to know if it's fixed until I can perform tasks on my PC for a certain amount of time without running into a BSOD. But for now, everything seems to be running normally since I've started updating those drivers. You also called to my attention the AR5BNFA222 Wireless Network Adapter. I didn't even know that existed before a couple of days ago, and I went ahead and disabled it. I don't even use a wireless network on my PC since it's hardwired via ethernet cable.

One of the many tools in my arsenal that makes my job easier is a password cracker. The only time(s) I need to use this is usually a workstation that lost trust with the domain, and no one knows the password to the local administrator account (which on Windows 7 is never administrator but found a trick to figure out the local account). What this CD does is you boot to it, it's clearly Linux based but designed to change/clear the local administrator account password so you can get into the PC, re-add it to the domain, and go on about your day. Also for those saying ""why don't you just use  the cache account"". Usually when a PC that loses trusts to the domain and is connected during that time, it remembers that and at times the cache accounts won't let you in or/and they don't have the necessary permissions to do what needs to be done. 
Here is the catch: first I don't know who makes it and I am yet to be the one that downloads it via internet. Every time I try to go and find it I get tons of porn websites and a few times a virus which that I now need to fix. But I know it's Linux based and very popular for I have seen many colleagues use it throughout my career at all the places I have worked at. I asked those where did they find it and they couldn't remember: great!
Why looking for it?
I got complaints from my colleagues that it doesn't work which I thought they weren't doing it right. Then one day I needed it and it didn't work. Between some tests and a little commonsense I figured out why. This CD is designed to work for Windows 7 and before BUT only for 32-bit machines. It can't find the Windows directory on a 64-bit PC hence the issue. So I would like the latest version hoping it has that issue resolved but again I don't know where to look. Not sure if I am 100% right on this but that is the pattern I am seeing.
Note this has nothing to do with hacking even thought technically that is what it does. No malicious intent involved and saves me from having to rebuild a PC. If you have a better solution I am open to those ideas as well.
I really hope this thread isn't removed.

For a windows based solution, I would try the following. It can enable the hidden Administrator account, clear passwords and elevate User Accounts. Here is a good guide on enabling the hidden local Administrator Account. The guide uses an older version

I remember I once used something similar like you described to find my brother's Windows login password (xD) but now can't remember its name. It was before 6-7 years ago, so I know this is possible :)

Yeah, I'm going to +1 starrouter on that Ophcrack disc.
Pretty straight forward - drop it in & unless someone has really ramped up their PW, shouldn't take too long to find it.
My download didn't come with any surprises and when I was searching for it, it came right up, porn-free. :guitar:
Tested it at the house before I took it to the client and it cracked all but 1 of the 4 accounts I created.
The one it wasn't able to crack was a ridiculously long and complicated PW I created just to test it's muster.
Don't really want to give the link out, but Google or DuckDuckGo will help you find your way here.
Hope that helps.

I feel like I should know the answer to this question, but...
Okay, so I used to have an external HD but it fritzed. I've been using Google Drive and/or Dropbox to back up files at work. However, I'm trying to figure out how I can continue to use these services effectively and yet in a way that doesn't create more work for myself.
What are some best practices when it comes to backing up files? Is there a way I can make this easy on myself so that I don't have to sync every single file I create (like an auto sync feature that could run every day at a certain time)? What is the best way to make sure that I'm backing up all my files but avoiding duplicates? (Ex: if I have a folder with three files in it and I add another file, syncing the folder would, I'm assuming, sync the original three files again as well as the first...correct?)
Any other tips and tricks/words of advice?
Thanks so much!

You could use a product like Crashplan that allows you to automate both phyiscal and cloud backup.  you can choose the source location of the data and then chose your destination (cloud or local) I belive its $60 for a year for unlimited backspace for personal use.  http://www.code42.com/crashplan/

Google drive is a good place to start but it shuld not be used alone, a backup should be done in multiple places, not just online or just on an external hard-drive or just on DVD discs or just on usb sticks but rather across a combination of as many meida types as you can get hold of. If you hunt thruogh the links below you will find i have written several long posts on this site about how i suggest backing things up but my summary would be this:
1. multiple backups, data in less than 3 places is so easily lost it doesn't really ""exist"". Have atleast, a copy on your computer, a copy on an online service, a copy on removable media in your house and a second copy on removable media, preferably in a close friend or family member's house.
2. avoid syncing like methods of backup. these run the risk that if the file on your computer is edited in such a way that it is ruined, rather than being deleted(exmaple, your novel typed in microsoft word is not deleted from file explorer but is instead opened and every word but the title deleted)then the edited (but effectively wrecked) copy will write over the backup copies. This is why backups shold be separte from your computer and not synced.
3.backup often, make manual bacups of any important files every time you change them and don't write over old backups with new ones. When a usb, dvd or external hard-drive is full of backups, put it somewhere safe and get a new one for later backups.
4.only backups stuff that is worth backing up. By this i mean backup your documents, videos, pictures, music, zip archives, installers for some programs but don't back up stuff in folders like C:\program files as that sort of stuff cannot be restored if it ever needs to be. 
5. make system image backups, but you only need 1 or 2 of them. Make a system image backup of your computer when all the programs you use are installed, everything is running well and you are sure it is not infected with any viruses. Put this system image on a sub or external hard-drive, put that drive somewhere safe and leave it. This is not for backing up personal files, it is for backing up system settings and programs, it should be used only when you have system problems and want to go back to when your system was in a good state. You might want to make 2 or 3 copies but once you have a good system image from a date when everything worked wel you don't need to make more recent ones, just backup the instaler exe file for anything good you installed after the system image. (example, a system image is made of a clean well running system in january. in february you download and install some wonderful new program. then keep january's system image as it is and just save the installer exe file for the wonderful new program onto a usb drive. If you have a system problem in, lets say july, first use the system image to restore the system to it's well working january state, then use the usb to reinstall the backed up copy of your wonderful new program's installer and run it to install the wonderful new program on the restored to clean state system.)
6. only back things up when you change them. If you are working on some great novel as a .txt file save a copy of it to a usb drive (or into an online account like google drive, using the browser interface not the ""google drive for your desktop"" program) when you finish work on it each night, don't save over the old versions. change the name of the file before backing up so that the new versin and old version happily co-exist on the backup drive.

In CS5 and CS5.1 respectivly (two different pc's) when increasing  brush size of the various tools, part of the circle indicating the brush size dissapears, in essence leaving the full O for a small brush and only seeing a part of the brush ""circle"" with larger sizes. 
Depending on how much the brush size is increased it may be anywhere from a half to quarter circle visible on the image file. Actual brush size in pixels is dependant on image size, for example an 800 x 1000 pixel image might be at 50 pixel brush size, while a 2400 x 3000 px image, the issue would occur at say 120 pixel brush size, which i'm thinking would be a direct relationship to brush/image size as opposed to a random occurance.
I've also changed various brush options in preferences to no avail.
Is this simply a CS5/5.1 oddity that one needs to live with?

#15- hi britechguy, thanks. It was suggested by a Spectrum (Time Warner Cable) rep when we upgraded from their Standard package (TV box w. DVR) who had no vested interest as we elected to not rent their router, and to look more into the $70-80 price range for best results. We're going to give it a go, along with a newer iPad which will be comparatively more, for sure.
Edit: also for a better range/signal strength.

r.a.d.,
What you need to do is to look at what wireless capabilities your existing devices have, what upgrades (if any) you anticipate you might have with new equipment, then feature match to a router.
Price is really not the metric to use.  Just find out what sort of wireless protocols (and you'll have nothing earlier than G) your various devices use and get a router that will support the fastest one, perhaps with Wireless ac as well, but not necessarily.  Just remember that even if the router supports the fastest one, the only time the fastest throughput will be achieved (and not at the theoretical maximums, either) is between the router and that device.  As soon as you use the router as the middleman between two devices the maximum speed you will get is that of the slowest participant in the interaction.

midimusicman79, have always used Shields Up (always passed) but had never heard of SpeedGuide Security Scan, just tried it via iPad (85 ports scanned, 0 open, 24 closed and 61 filtered), and it's quick. Thanks.
Gibson's UPnP says 'good news' as equipment didn't respond to their probes. Router is an el-cheapo off the shelf Belkin ($29), but soon we'll upgrade to take better advantage of increased ISP speed. 
You are welcome! 
Since we live in the countryside, our ISP provides approximately 10 Mbps ADSL, but soon we will upgrade to fiber-optics, which will provide increased speed, and according to a local city's electronics store's sales engineer, this is ""a new world"" in speed.
We have an ASUS 802.11ac Dual-band AC1900 PCI-E WLAN access point, and we will also get a new ZyXEL router with similar speed.
We are aware of the speed anatomy on the 2.4 GHz band vs. the 5 GHz band, but will probably use the 2.4 GHz band due to the longer range it provides, since there is little interference where we live and there is also the difference between theoretical and practical speeds.

Our new router will get an approximate range of 246 feet, but the distance to the nearest neighbor is luckily much longer. :whistle:

Hello.I am posting this instead of friend of mine..
Everytime he start his computer normally,he get BSOD (one in picture attached below).
Everytime he start his computer in SafeMode (Any,+Networking,Command Promt),it just freeze in one point.
When he tries Startup Repair, it just freezes in middle of Loading Files thing.
He was not able to boot it up even if he clicked option ""Last known good Configuration"".
Before this,he was able to start his windows normally,but he had one problem,which was the Colored Vertical lines all over (actually not all over,but pretty much whole screen) his Monitor (They show up when The ""Starting Windows"" Thing starts).
And Before that,he also had some BSODs related to GPU Drivers,which he was able to fix.
I suspect that his PC is infected with some kind of malware,but,after all, I am not expert,so that's why I am posting this here ..
The newest Problem (With 0x000000BE Bsod) started about 4-5 days ago...

I can provide You some answers for him:
OS - Windows 7 (x86)
What was original installed OS on system - Windows 7
Is the OS an OEM version or full retail Version - It was OEM,but after he tried to Update it to Windows 10,because of failure to install windows 10,it rolled back to windows 7 and from that moment his OS became non-genuine.
Age of the computer - Around 7-8 years..
Age of OS installation - If the Reinstallation of Win7 after failing to install Win10 counts,then maybe week and a half.If not,then maybe Year or so.
Laptop or Desktop Computer - Desktop
Everything else (Exact model number,CPU,Video Card, Motherboard and Power Supply) I don't know. I'll ask him,so after he tells me,I'll post those things here.

Unfortunately due to this license issue and terms of use we are not able to offer any help until the license issue is resolved. If they have a genuine license for Windows 10, then the best option may be to try and backup the files using one of the following methods or a Linux distro and perform a new clean install of Windows 10 as follows.

One more thing I forgot to mention is I would highly recommend that they run the following hardware tests before installing Windows 10.
H/W Diagnostics:Please start by running these bootable hardware diagnostics:http://www.carrona.org/memdiag.html (read the details at the link)http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html (read the details at the link) - Test ALL of the hard drives.

I would start with the hardware test first and make sure there are no issues. With that error it can likely be hardware issues. Did he run Windows 10 successfully on his system before? I need to see the specs of his system to make sure it is compatible with Windows 10, otherwise he can try correcting his Windows 7 license issue and continue using it.  If Windows 10 was ever legally installed he should not have to purchase another license and it should activate automatically or he can use some software I can recommend to retrieve the key.

He never had Windows 10 on that PC. Only Windows 7. I will make bootable usb with that h/w diagnostics thing and I will run it on his system. If there are no errors,so that means that he can Reinstall Windows 7 with new licence? His Licence was normal until he tried to Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10,after failing,his licence became non-genuine.Why that happened?
His Windows 7 licence was OEM,so he tried to upgrade to Win10 without purchasing new licence. He have no problem buying new,but better upgrading for free than spending money for same thing.

Start with the H/W tests and let me know the results. 
He never had Windows 10 on that PC. Only Windows 7
Okay, I misunderstood. He will need to contact Microsoft and to try and get the license issue fixed if he has a genuine Windows 7 license or he can try using his key and see if it will allow him to upgrade to Windows 10.

I don't think that contacting Microsoft will do something at all,after all,his licence was OEM,so he never purchased one. After We do H/W test on his PC,I'll post results here,and if there are no problems involving Hardware,then he will purchase Windows 10 or 7 licence,and we will install it like that.
Thanks for help.
Expect results in week or so (I am currently on Vacation,so I am not able to do that earlier,or I will see if someone else can do that for me and take a picture of results,so in that case I'll post picture)..

Malwarebytes is completely gone. Even Revo has no file info. I tried reinstalling and it failed.  I downloaded and installed the newest version of Malwarebytes. It will not install. Message about another application using a resource.
Bit Defender is alive but has been unable to download updates. Turns out for at least March 27. I tried to update it. Nothing.
An issue that may or may not be involved. I installed a new router (Asus AC3100) a few weeks ago. Everything worked fine, and internet access was very fast. Then I could no longer sign on as the administrator. I have tried a number of permutations of a logon to no avail. I have the name and password written down ,and it should not have changed. A previous older router also did this, and it was very slow. I did not associate it with the new router until ti started to get very slow. And I could not log on.
Using the computer, it is very slow to log on to a site or download material.
Last week I used the system to activate a new Motorola phone. It worked.
I have run Farbar and have the files available.
A several weeks ago, my system was trying to encrypt all of my drives. I interrupted it. When I tried to kill the process, it wanted me to enter a password. I was afraid this would allow a possible attacker to do a ransom ware trick. I reformatted all drives, and installed a previous installation from Macrium.

Hi, First of all Thanks for this wonderfull forum, i think ive said it before but cant say it enough.
Sorry if i posted in the wrong section.. Its not really a specific question, just need some thoughts and ideas..
Ive just formated my computer, ive installed all ""security software"" Kaspersky Internet Security, SuperAntiSpyware,Malwarebytes Anti-Malware etc etc..
I was thinking as ive just formated the computer, im sure there should be stuff i could do to prevent the need for a another format.. A thought crossed my mind, a Restoration/Backup software that creates a restore point seems useful at this point as the computer is newly formated..
I know Windows 7 have System Restore are there anything better out there and more usefull.. not that its bad, just asking.
Any other ideas on precautions i can take, id be happy to hear..
Thank you, appreciate your time spent to help out.

Back ups are definitely a good idea, since you have reformatted,etc. Windows 7 has has vastly improved in this area from the previous versions. I have a System Repair Disk and also made System Image Recovery Disks using rewritable DVD (takes about 4 to 6). Update twice a month.
You can also look into freeware such as 'Replicator"" from karenware.com
These work for me. Other members will no doubt have their preferences.

100% excellent answer. I myself do computer repairs as well and tell folks about backup, etc...but do you think I do it? NO!

I  started backing up regularly only about a year ago after a Windows system restore failed me.
Some people even encrypt all their backups, so that if they ever fall into the wrong hands, they are unusable.

What i do with all my servers is just create a task Schedule (Windows server allows one time backup but not schuled backups, crazy i know) where you execute the following command line below which backs up to a secondary harddrive.
C:\Windows\System32\wbadmin.exe start backup -backupTarget:\\targetMachine\E -include:C: -allCritical -vssfull -quiet
With Windows 7 just create a weekly routin in the backup and restore section in control panel.
Odviously your Targetmachine  would be the name fo your computer and the E drive is the target drive to store the image and the C is the drive i want to backup.
Hope that helps

To my knowledge transfering data from one laptop usb to another laptop (or desktop to desktop) usb is not possible, nor recommended. Most computers have an RJ45 port (ethernet) which is likely faster than the usb ports and already setup for file transfer if networking sharing is enabled.
EDIT: you can not copy data by putting a cable into 2 usb ports on the same computer. The hard drives if plugged into the computer through IDE or SATA would already be connected by the sata controller. You could copy data from 1 drive directly to the other from windows explorer or ""computer"" drive  to drive (E) (or whatever the drive letters were).

If you have 2 computers running side by side, then you have to use a bridged USB cable or networking USB cable. Ordinary USB cable should not be used, it will shortcircuit + and - voltage wires on both computers. You can also use your internet router to connect two computers, just attach both computers to the router with Ethernet cable, USB cable or over Wi-Fi. Then you can access them in the Network section of the Computer.
But if you have both HDD's in the same computer. Then attach both to the motherboard (both data cable and power cable), then boot into either operating system (better use Windows 7 to boot). You can choose hard disk boot priority in the BIOS or press F12 key (or something similar depending on your BIOS) to choose a hard disk to boot. When Windows boots, the second hard disk would be visible and you can copy files from one to another hard disk.

You earlier said that Windows 7 HDD is first boot device and if you want to boot from XP HDD then you have to make BIOS changes.
he WIN 7 OS is what i have as first boot device,and if i want use WINXP i have to go into the BIOS an change boot order with the F-2 key.
So I figured why make BIOS changes? Just let it boot to the first device (Windows 7) when both of the hard disks are connected.
In any case, you can press F12 (not F2) very quickly as soon as the Dell logo appears when you power on your PC. Press it 3-4 times quickly. You would see a menu from which you can select a hard disk to boot from.
When Windows 7 runs, it will detect new hard disk and you can access it from Windows Explorer just like any other disk drive.

Hello everyone!
I am the adult and technical services librarian at a public library, meaning that in addition to my regular old ""librarian duties,"" I am also in charge of updating the public computers (25 of them) every month.
(Before I continue, I should note that although I have been using computers since the age of seven [I'm now 26] and know what I'm doing and can help our patrons, I don't have any experience in IT or computer science--or anything of the sort. So you'll have to excuse me if I use incorrect terminologies and so forth. I am still learning!)
There are a couple pieces of software that are currently driving me batty with their update notifications. Namely, Adobe Reader and Flash0x3B Java0x3B and iTunes.
We have DeepFreeze Enterprise on our public computers so that any changes patrons make to the computers while they are in their ""frozen state"" are erased after the computer is restarted. I do not want these update notifications to auto pop-up when the patrons log on0x3B they can't really mess up the computer but if they try to update, DeepFreeze will just negate it. And, if I'm being honest, some patrons find it confusing...they know they're not supposed to make changes to the computer but when these notifications pop up in their faces, some of them don't know what to do.
I've tried everything I can think of. I've told the applications quite a few times to never check for updates (as I will do it myself when I am updating the computers), but it seems like every time I am working on updating I keep getting the notifications and have to once again tell them to stop. Java in particular is guilty of this. I also used msconfig.exe --> startup and unchecked Java, Apple, iTunes, Adobe, etc. but it seems that when I go and update the software, I get those pop-ups stating that the software would like to make changes to the computer and it reverts back to what it was doing before (hopefully you know what I mean...I'm on the reference desk so I can't go to one of our public terminals to go through the process in order to be more detailed).
A friend of mine who is good with computers said that there's really nothing I can do...that every time I update Java I will have to disable update checks. Call me naive but this doesn't seem possible! Any knowledge/help/advice in this area would be much appreciated.

It does seem like you could find a work-around.  Do you use a driver update software?  If this were to be used on autoschedule, you could have them updated automatically and schedule this to happen while they were not in use.  The Deep Freeze program certainly seems to be the real issue.  Have you contacted their technical support to see what others with similar issues have done?

I have an unusual situation.  I have two computers in my office connected to a KVN switch.  I have 12 computers upstairs connected by a KVN switch.  I would like to be able to control the computers upstairs from my office - copy files in both directions and control programs on the other computers.  
I tried Synchronicity but I couldn't get it to work.  It would switch the mouse but not the screen.  They couldn't help me and refunded my money.
I got a free trial of Multiplicity, but due to the hurricane and other issues I didn't get to try it during the trial period.  Will Multiplicity work for what I want?  It controls only up to 9 computers, so could I have two copies of it running on one computer in my office?  (Or, if not, one copy on each of my computers downstairs, each controlling some of the computers upstairs.)

I bought one years ago... has been sat gathering dust ever since. lol
Always just listened to the beeps in those situations.
My current mobo has a alpha-numerical LED info like those, on board. A flashing skull with light up eyes also... it must be quality stuff.. hahah.

Some extra info.
During motherboard initialisation (before the operating system starts to load), the BIOS writes numbers to a diagnostic port as it performs each step of starting up. With a knowledge of those numbers (which are effectively manufacturer dependant) you can identify at exactly which stage of start up a 'dead' motherboard failed. A Post card (as linked to in #2) or TsVk!, on 's 2 hex digit seven segment LED display display codes written to the diagnostic port. TsVk!, on 's beep codes are a coarser indication of the initialisation failure point.
In order to make any sense of the codes, you do need as list of codes appropriate to your board and a fairly deep knowledge of how motherboards work.Many, Many yeas ago, I was tech manager at a PC builder company in the UK, I built my own post card (as they were not widely available back then), and used it to test returns. Now, for occasional use, I'd not bother with a discrete post cards. I'd used the on-board 2 digit hex display of the post code if it existed, or the beep codes if it did not (once upon a time I'd have just sniffed the board!)
Unless you are in the trade and dealing with many PCs, it's not worth buying a separate POST code board - the beep codes and other diagnostic lights on the board will be enough to tell you if it is a memory, display or CPU initialisation fault. Anything more than that and you will be RMAing the board.

..rd. A flashing skull with light up eyes also... it must be quality stuff.. hahah.
I have one of those as well, or at least one of its siblings... ... Sadly it turned out to be far from the quality that I used to associate with that manufacturer, and I will not be sad to see the passing of that manufacturers mobo division (whereas one I might have been).  The board never worked right with a 3rd gen I7 processor in it...  And yes - I spent hours staring at intermittent post codes on the boards hex display trying to get the manufacturer to recognise that their Ivy-bridge capable bioses for this particular board were crap!... In the end I cut my losses, and bought a mobo that actually worked from another manufacturer to use as my main PC.
The dodgy board, electric blue skull and all, now leads a far less interesting life than it could have had, running on an i5 2nd gen CPU and acting as a virtual host for testing server configurations, and never getting a chance to do what real ""Extreme series"" boards do.  Serves it right for crossing me :)

I had trouble with that board also, with an i7 processor... I removed the pci NVidia card and the problems went away. :whistle:
Fortunate I don't actually need the additional graphics card or it would have been demoted to a test machine role also.

Hello everyone. A few days ago I got a virus that has control over my browser. It can redirect google searches to Yahoo or Bing and it could shut the browser down when you enter the names or visit the websites of certain anti-virus programs. The latter problem has gone away but the former is still there. At one point whatever the virus is, it could also shut down explorer.exe as soon as you typed the letters ""adw."" I tried different anti-virus programs and asked for help on Tom'sguide and didn't get much feedback so at this point I would just like to system restore but system restore is being blocked. It also wouldn't open in safe mode. Anyone have a solution? Thanks in advance.

I didn't remove it initially because the guide said ""Do not clean"" but it didn't stop the redirects. In the temp folder I see something called ""Execute2App.exe."" It was created on the same date I got the virus (4/12). Should I delete it?

The google redirect seems to be gone! Still having issues opening system restore though. Also having another issue with a website called ""linkhaitao.com"" that redirects to that page briefly and then redirects to the page I was originally on. Happens every time I go here http://us.asos.com/boohooman/boohooman-denim-jacket-with-fleece-collar-in-light-wash/prd/8829773

HI,
I have started experiencing issues with Avast Premier where the Antivirus Service would unexpectedly stop responding and appear in Services as neither Running or Stopped. I had run it on this computer before but after I upgraded my SSD in my laptop to a 1TB device and reinstalled Windows I didnt reinstall Avast until I recently started to do most of my college work in local Starbucks more often. I installed it last week for both of my laptops and both of them have this problem. I have tried researching this and I just dont have the time, to figure this out.. However, I need Avast to be working, because I need to be sure that my stuff is protected on the many public networks I use. If I am infected, this will probably be majorly different process because of the way I store my data. I have listed an overview of how my data is stored.
Computers:
Both Run Windows 10
My Findings:
I have noticed that the Avast Antivirus Service will crash randomly, when I am not doing any intensive processes on the computer such as using a Web Browser.
The Antivirus will also crash during an large amount of files transferring, or during a large scan.
I have looked in the logs for Avast an it does not stay consistent with errors. In one case it says that I do not have an active vault for my user, before saying that it cant start a process and crashes.

Another instance it says it cant open the licesne file, and then Lists an exception that I cant find anything on.  Event Logs mentions it was terminated..
Storage of Data:
I have three places I store my stuff, one accessible anywhere through the cloud, two of them are on premise Network Shares.
I use OpenDrive for my Cloud Storage, a large amount of data is stored on it. My College work is stored in a folder that syncs to an offline copy on both of my laptops and when a change is applied it syncs to the cloud and the other laptop. The same goes for the Downloads folder, Documents, and Pictures because there are many instances where I need to access those crucial folders from another computer or at an offline location, so those sync.
I also store files on my colleges servers using a share, however I do not know what is running and I rarely access it only on special circumstances.
My last source of storage is my 8TB File Server running Linux. A couple weeks before this I did Copy files from a computer I hadnt touched for 2 years to the share and also an External hard drive that one of the laptops affected was plugged into. The system was going very slow and was acting up. I thought it might have been because of it using an old hard drive. The data from that computer is on the 8TB file server.
Things I tried:
Using Repair Feature
Reinstalling
Reinstalling with different license file, (Beforehand it was complaining about the license then said it was corrupted, but the previous reinstall took the license and didnt complain)
Using the Avast Uninstaller Tool and reinstalling
Used The Avast Uninstaller Tool and then Installed using the Offline Uninstaller
MBAM Scan (Nothing turned up)
During this, I will be doing one laptop at a time.
Thank You,

Since you're talking about public and private keys, I assume you're using a product that uses asymmetric crypto. Is it BCTextEncoder you use?

If they store it in a directory, it means they don't use the Windows certificate stores (which you can view with the mmc + certificates snap-in).
Normal usage of asymmetric crypto is that it is only used to encrypt small bits of data. Usually, when an application is designed to encrypt messages and files with asymmetric crypto, what is done is that the message is encrypted with a symmetric algorithm, the key for that algorithm is generated randomly and it is this symmetric key that is encrypted with the asymmetric algorithm and then added to the message.
So to decrypt the message, you type your password, which unlocks your private key, which is then used to decrypt the symmetric key, which is then used to decrypt the message/file.

I have had the Google Toolbar on my Firefox since version 3.
At about version 4, Google and Firefox seemed to have a squabble and Google withdrew their toolbar by making it incompatible with Firefox. Big laugh to me, I just got round their embargo and still have my Google Toolbar on Firefox current version 22.
For users like me who had the Google Toolbar before FF version 4, here is what to do :-
Start>Run>%appdata%>OK>Mozilla>Firefox>rmwshom9.default>extensions>{3112ca9c-de6d-4884-a869-9855de68056c}>install.rdf>bar along to <em:maxVersion>XX.0.*</em:maxVersion>about half way along on top line and change the ""XX"" to your version number - mine is currently set at 24.0>close. You can enter what value you like, 30.0 would be  fine.
A simpler way is to install Firefox add-on ""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkcompatibility/ Disable Add-on Compatibility Checks
This add-on disables the Firefox compatibility check which tags the Google Toolbar as being incompatible and allows it to be installed and/or updated. It is said that with this add-on installed, the Google Toolbar can be downloaded and installed on Firefox. Always make sure that current updates are actioned.
There are other fiddles available if you surf the web on this subject, but I regard the two described as being the most popular.

Firstly, I know these tips I am posting may be fundamental and basic to the geek fraternity, but a significant number of ordinary not-so-knowledgeable users are members of Forums. They are the target of my hopefully useful tips.
I would suggest that the taskbar is unlocked,  just  right click the taskbar clock and uncheck the ""Lock the Taskbar""."" If you place the  cursor on the top taskbar line, you can customise the taskbar for depth and width by dragging when the vertical or horizontal arrows appear.
To get any desktop program onto the Quick Launch/Taskbar is easy, simply left click on the program icon, hold down the mouse key and drag the icon to the taskbar, release the mouse key. All done. The initial icon does not move and remains in place.
To delete an icon from the taskbar, right click, select ""Delete"" on the pop-up panel and it is gone.
For a program not on the desktop, right click the icon>Send to>desktop>Create icon. An icon then appears on the desktop and you proceed as above. Then just delete the temporary desktop icon.
When finished, lock the taskbar by rechecking the ""Lock the Taskbar"" as described above.

Many thanks for that additional information.
I am myself aware of these manipulations, but did not wish to get too involved, so kept it short to the taskbar aspect.
Pleased you added that, it is an important point and linked with my taskbar effort,  just about ties it all up.

Hey,
I've recently been encountering 'issues' of computers running slow around my workplace, while I've never seen this myself others seem to say computers are terribly slow during different times of the day and / or selected days of the week.
Now what I'm trying to do is to either prove them wrong or find out for myself does it really run slower and if so why?
What I basically need is something that would let me monitor the computers behavior other than the Event Viewer and try to locate the problem if it's hardware / software / network or related to any other system.
I find it hard to grasp how a Quad Core machine on around 2.4GHz with 4-8 gigs of memory can run slowly with just Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit, Lotus notes 8.5.2, Office 2007 and Adobe Reader X with SCCM agent & McAfee agent running in the background. Computers are connected to a domain and group policies are applied.
The OS itself runs pretty much on 'oobe' settings, while this may not be the best optimization it shouldn't affect performance with just the above mentioned software.
Is there any basic optimization I've missed out on? Is there anything I can run to actually find out what is causing these mystical slowdowns at 2pm on a Friday afternoon?
Whenever I check the performance monitor in Win7 I'm yet to see values high enough to cause issues.

First: a good resource -> http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic87058.htmlSlow Computer/browser? Check Here First0x3B It May Not Be MalwareBased on the cyclical nature of the slowdowns I would say that the sluggishness is likely due to uncontrolled applications and pre-scheduled events. Pre-scheduled events can include things like scheduled antivirus scans and system or application updates. Check running applications for auto-update features and check your scheduled tasks.

Ask your co-workers what they consider slow. In my experience, the word ""slow"" can mean completely different things depending on who you're talking to. Booting/running slow? Browsing/downloading is slow? Burning is slow?
When I have a client say that their computer is slow I ask them questions as to what aspect they find slow.

I did a job recently where the company complained about all their computers being slow.. turns out they had a guy on the network that was seeding 50+ torrents, slowing everybody's network speed.
The actual cause of a computer being sluggish is way out of my court, but what is in my court are indefinite expressions like ""slow"", ""fast"", ""hot"", ""cold, ""high"", ""low"", those kind of expressive but rather useless adjectives.
Your reply is superbly put and is the cornerstone question of any  serious problem analysis and constructive action. 
What is ""slow"" ? I may have missed it, but I cannot see any qualified value of what ""slow"" means to the OP. In any case, what datum and unit of measurement is used to enable deviations to be described as ""slow"" or ""fast"" ? Such adjectives are purely relative.
A computer's processor speed describes the maximum number of calculations per second the processor can perform, and is given in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the larger the number, the faster and more powerful the processor needs to be.
So are we talking of CPU deficiency due to overload  or inadequate CPU capacity to handle the load imposed ? Will not a glance at Task Manager reveal a clue as to what programs are taking up CPU capacity and putting the brake on ?

Good point.. that it may be someone on the network. I am trying to clean up one of my laptops that is on the slow side to no avail. I was thinking it could be my router or network....we have comcast in a moderatly populated area

If you do not have a massive Email activity and plenty of disk space, there is no need to compact the files. Surfing the web on compacting, gives me the wobbles. Many users have had problems with compacting with lost files, folders and messages. Me ? No thanks, I play it safe and leave compacting in the minds of enthusiastic MS protagonists.
When you reach 100 OE open and closures a pop-up will come on screen saying ""To free up disk space, Outlook Express can compact messages.  This may take up to a few minutes.  OK?  Cancel""
From then on, every time you open OE  the message to compact will pop up. Excruciatingly annoying. 
But never fear, you can get  rid of this curse so that it only pops up every 100 open and closures.
To reset it manually:
1. Close Outlook Express and all message windows.
2. Click Start> Run and type without quotes ""regedit"".
3. Navigate to this key 0x3B-
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Identities\{GUID}\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express\5.0
where GUID is the long number used for your Identity.
4. In the right-hand pane, double-click ""Compact Check Count"", then change the value to zero. I chose the ""decimal"" value option when resetting the value in the ""compact check count"" dialog box, it is a normal digital value.
5. Close Registry Editor.
All done.
Having set the Compact Check Count to zero,  the pop-up panel will not occur again until it reaches 100, then you simply repeat the procedure and reset it to zero.

Don't bother with all that, this is not an infection, it's just a bad ad that doesn't close properly.  Follow these instructions from Lifehacker to kill ads in utorrent and you'll be fine.
https://lifehacker.com/disable-ads-in-utorrent-via-settings-826283231
Alternately, double-clicking on the title bar of the utorrent app (normally just maximizes/windowizes (is that a word?)) is enough to get the cyberghost ad to give up control, though it's clumsy.

Hello,
I've noticed my laptop is running quite hard. Checking the Task manager svchost.exe *32 is using approx 50% of my CPU. I have had to set the affinity to only use 1 CPU and reduce the priority of this process to ""Low"" to reduce the load.
I have run several malware, Antivirus and Rootkill programs and they cannot find the problem.
I'v downloaded process explorer to try and see into the service however upon hovering over the service in question, the label says [Access Denied].
Opening up the service shows me the process tab however for some reason on this process window there is no ""Services"" tab visible whereas on other process I can see it and view all the processes under it.
Can someone please help. There's something not right here but it seems to be quite heavily embedded. Thanks!

You should not have to make any of those adjustments - hopefully you have not afflicted your system in some way by doing that.
It is normal to see several to many svchost processes running but most of the time their CPU usage should be zero zero with an occasional blip.
With Windows you don't need Process Explorer to figure out what Services are running under each svchost Process and which Service is afflicted - that is now mostly built in to Task Manager, Resource Monitor but no screenshots can be posted here by mere mortals.
A frequent problem is the Service associated with Windows Update (wuauserv) so a quick check would be to go to:
Control Panel
Windows Update
Change settings
set it to Never check for updates
Clcik OK to save the adjustment
Restart your system and see how things look.
Unfortunately screen shots are not allowed here - at least by mere mortals.
Knowing that under each svchost Process are important Windows Services you can zero in on the Service that is afflicted using Task Manager.
With the PID (Process ID) column enabled in Task Manager note the PID associated with the svchost Process that is running amok (let's say the PID is 1154).
In Task Manger click the Performance tab, the in the bottom click Resource Monitor.
You may need to minimize Task Manager to get it out of the way leavening Resource Monitor open.
Drag the edges of Resource Monitor to make it wide enough to see things.
In Resource Monitor click Services once or twice to expand all the running Services which should be sorted by PID (or click the PID column header to sort by PID).
Scroll though the list of Services until you find the PID that matches the afflicted svchost Process which would be 1154 in our example.
There may be one or most Services running with that PID.
In Resource Monitor look at the CPU column for the Services running under that PID.
If you don't see the CPU column drag the edge of of the Window to make it wider so you can see the CPU column.
You will be able to see the amount of CPU each Service running under that PID is using.
Most of the time the CPU for those Services should be zero so if you have a Service that is constantly consuming much CPU what Service would that be?

Hi. I'm running Windows 7. Every time I open Chrome, I get a popup from HitmanPro.Alert, telling me ""Intruder Alert. Critical browser functions have been compromised by a potentially malicious program. DO NOT enter any personal information on websites. Online banking is unsafe until your computer has been scanned and cleaned. Please check your computer for malware and software updates."" It then prompts me to scan with HitmanPro.
To my knowledge, I haven't made any recent changes, except for an update to Steam. No downloaded programs, except Google's Software Removal Tool, which found nothing. No new extensions.
I've run through the following list of programs in this order (I know I went overboard, but I figured the more the merrier):
rkill - one issue, Windows Service Integrity: TBS [Missing Service]
Malwarebytes - nothing
Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit - nothing
tdsskiller - nothing
AdwCleaner - nothing
HitmanPro - just some tracking cookies
After all of those, upon starting Chrome, I still get the same warning.
Also, and I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my problem, my computer has decided it won't restart anymore. If I try to restart, it hangs and I have to press the reset button. If I shut it down, though, it starts just fine.
Thanks for any help you can give me.

Hi. Encountering similar problems here. Since 22 March, around noon time.
Windows 10, Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge. Same error message as posted by SlabBacon.
Antivirus: F-Secure
Malwarebytes - nothing
Kaspersky Anti-Ransomware - nothing
UnHackMe - nothing (just some suspicious that I see since a long time)
HitmanPro - just some tracking cookies
HitmanPro.Alert scan (started independently of HitmanPro scan) - nothing
Spybot-S&D - nothing special, mainly tracking cookies
A clue could be: ""Hitmanpro.Alert 3"" was installed (automatically, I guess as update/upgrade) on 22 march!
Several reboots did not help either.
I can still use my computer, it does not hang.
When checking the information that comes together with the alert, I cannot discover any clues what the problem / root cause could be.
What would be your advice how to spot the intruder?
Or is it a false positive (how to prove that)?
I am thinking about disabling/stopping/de-installing Hitmanpro.Alert. Would you recommend to do so (or not)?
Thank you for your understanding and support!

I have a number of clients that reported this same issue to me starting yesterday. 
Upon starting a browser a message pops that says ""Critical browser functions have been compromised by a potentially malicious program. DO NOT enter any personal information on websites.  Online banking is unsafe until your computer has been scanned and cleaned.  Please check your computer for malware and software updates""
For as many as have the problem at the same time it would seem to be a HMPA false positive but I somehow expected more discussion of it on here.  I myself recall seeing the HMPA update message but I have not rebooted my machine since or restarted a browser so maybe I will experience the issue at that point as I expect others will too. 
Typically when this happens we uninstall, download an updated version w/o the issue and keep going but I am not in the know about ""will the new one still be free like the one we got back when?""

One user simply wanted it off his machine.  I told him we had put it on years ago in hopes of providing an extra layer of protection against cryptolocker viruses.  I failed to verify his version number before it was uninstalled. 
Another client machine had 3.7.6 build 738.  I checked the link on the Surfright (guess they are Sophos now) page and saw it showed 3.7.1.376 https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/downloads.aspx so why not roll it back to previous (non-problematic) version?  Only because when you uninstall and download what is purported to be 3.7.1.723 it reinstalls 3.7.6.738 and still blows up upon startup with same detection.

I tried to roll back to HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.1.723.
For this I downloaded HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.1.723 from their website.
When starting the installation with that .exe file the splash screen shows it would install HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.6.738 (which is the version that causes trouble on my machine).
Obviously, I canceled the install.
So I cannot roll back this way. Does anybody have an idea where to download the HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.1.723?
Or have other remedies been identified in the meantime?
The version number of HMPA is shown in its title bar.

Uninstalled 3.7.6.738 on yet another client machine.  Found an old 3.0.42 build 190 and installed it (yes it was from 6/8/2015).  As soon as a browser was opened it popped a HMPA message ""An update is available.  It will be installed on reboot"" but I rebooted and it still gives that message when you start the browser but it seems that if you do not interact with it, the old version lives and your browser still works as opposed to being hijacked by what seems to be a HMPA false positive.  So we can either just uninstall HMPA or put an older one in from a previous download (but it may or may not really add any protection)

Hi RolandJS, Thanks for the names of the two sites. Unfortunately, they do not carry HMP nor HMPA.
I found that uptodown.com and filehorse.com carry old versions of HMP. But again, unfortunately, no HMPA....

I've found something interesting now. Sometimes, when I start my computer, Microsoft Security Essentials has its real-time protection turned off. In this case, I don't get a warning from HitmanPro.Alert0x3B but I can't turn MSE's real-time protection back on, as it just times out. However, if I start my computer and MSE's real-time protection is already on, then I do get a warning from HMPA upon opening Chrome.
Edit: Well shoot. I just tested this, by turning off real-time protection manually, and I'm still getting the warning from HMPA. So it only disappears when MSE's real-time protection is turned off when I first start my computer.

Hi everyone,
My Windows 10 PC was infected with a Trojan virus, that I think I caught and deleted. I've run Malwarebytes (Which initially caught some viruses), Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit and AVG and none show any viruses left. However, I ran ADWcleaner and it caught and cleaned a couple of dangerous programs.
However, the main issue still persists, that my PC can't properly connect to the internet. My PC says it's connected and I can load google related websites (Gmail, and Youtube) but any other websites (Reddit, this forum, etc.) won't load. I also can't log in to steam or other game launchers.
Over the past couple days our (Five roommates) internet has been acting up, slow speeds, inability to load certain websites, complete lack of connection, across both WiFi and Ethernet. All of the other devices are fine now, except mine. When the technician came in he said that it was potentially due to a virus pulling bandwith which then slows down the whole network.
When I go to the Router system information, my computer is the only device with a 'self-assigned' IP address, every other one is DHCP-IP. Is the IP address being affected by a virus? How do I make sure my PC is clean and is able to connect properly?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Hi Aussie,
Love your comment.
Don't you believe it, there are egg-heads walking around today that do not know who the President of the US is.  NASA have sent 9 missions to the Moon and a buggy to Mars, but probably half of these guys are still double clicking their Windows because they know no better. Perhaps they will log in to BC and read my post.
I am no dummy, good technical/scientific education, extensive high level, responsible career and I was double clicking for 4 years  before I  stumbled across single click. Never looked back since.
My simple brain says ""Why double  click when a single click is enough ?"" So I posted this to help others. I think that MS should have had single click as default.

Good point Aussie.
Being a single user myself, I have no experience of others using my PC, especially kids. As such, I did find the double click a monumental PITA.
Single clicking is the hypochondriacs dream for reducing the time taken for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, the keyboard thumpers nightmare to inflict them, by half.
President of the US ? What a silly question, everybody knows that - its Winston Churchill.

Because they may have kids and observe what Aussie said in keeping the double click for safety, or the cat may have a habit of walking all over their keyboard.  Or they simply do not know about it like myself for 4 years.
You would be surprised how many users, some experienced do not know the very fundamentals about  the built-in facilities and capabilities of Windows. Beyond their keyboard and screen, that is IT.

Just a thought, wouldn't single click tangle with click and drag. If a single click opens the application how would you drag it to, for example another folder.

There is no problem.
You single click to open a program, but when you want to drag, you keep the mouse key pressed down and drag. The program does not open with the key kept pressed down, it is only when you release it on the icon the program opens.

I use Linux but administrate Windows. I'm always having fun waiting for things that aren't going to open or closing things that I opened by accident.
My users would bleat  so loudly that I'd be looking for work if I changed them all to single click.

Just a thought, wouldn't single click tangle with click and drag. If a single click opens the application how would you drag it to, for example another folder.
I may just be not thinking straight haha.

There is no problem.
You single click to open a program, but when you want to drag, you keep the mouse key pressed down and drag. The program does not open with the key kept pressed down, it is only when you release it on the icon the program opens.
Ah right, thanks for the clarification.

I have never opened any program unintentionally with a single click. By mistake, yes, nobody is perfect. Experienced operators should not need double click protection against human error. I know of no other key operated device in our modern world of thousands of electronic contraptions which use a double click. It would drive people crackers on a telephone.
So why have a double  click on a PC ? No reason at all. The only concession I would make are kids and cats. But then kids use telephones.

Data has not been received from, device 'servername' within the expected time. The server or the ISP connection may have failed. 
We have noticed an issue where the server is online and can access the internet but is reported as overdue. Manually re-running checks on the Agent uploads data but scheduled uploads fail.
The solution to temporarily fix Advanced Monitoring Agent service is0x3B
Start --> Run --> services.msc --> Select Advanced Monitoring Agent --> Right Click -->Properties --> Log On tab --> Log on as: local or domain administrator 
1, Advance Monitoring Agent service is running under an Administrator account, so the problem is not this.
2, The ISP is fine as my company provides this.so this is not the problem
3, The Server, sometimes does replication, which I think is the cause of the failed to send data, because it is causing it to timeout,
4, I have read an article on web before that the timeout can be increased to prevent it from hanging.
Unfortunately it was not my role to implement this change, I would like to now hoe to as I can't seem to locate any article on how to do it, only pages about installing monitoring agents.
Can you please advise on how to increase the timeout.
