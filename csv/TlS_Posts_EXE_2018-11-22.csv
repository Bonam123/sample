Hi,
Here is my new project ArkDasm http://www.arkdasm.com
Its a 64-bit interactive disassembler. Its pre-alpfa version and still a lot of work left but IMHO basic functionality is finished.
I did not bother with context menu so please use keybord shortcuts instead. 
Keyboard shortcuts are pretty standard n(rename), x(show xref), ;(add comment), c(make code), d(make data), u(undefine) and more for a full list of shortcuts look into readme.pdf
The binary itself is 64-bit and vs2012 runtimes are required http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679",,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=15279

NO, that is the WORST thing to do! That would only lead to one more useless disassembler!
The is one really good disassembler: IDA
There would be room for another disassembler, an open source tool. Instead of starting 97 disassembler projects, which only have rudimentary features and will die soon because of a lack of support, all these authors should contribute to the same project.
Look at webbrowser engines: There are only THREE major engines: Trident (Internet Explorer), Gecko (Firefox, SeaMonkey, ...) and WebKit (Safari, Opera, Chrome, ...). The two open source engines Gecko and WebKit are great products, because thousands of developers contribute to each one.
Imagine if each of these developers startet to write his own engine instead. There would be hundreds of crappy webbrowser engines out there, none of which would be even close to Gecko or WebKit quality-wise.
NOBODY should start writing a new disassembler! It just doesn't make any sense!
The reverse engineering scene lacks good, coordinated software development. Right now, everybody is just wasting his time. The goal should be to creating something bigger, together, just like the open source guys.",[u'https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?p=87198#post87198'],https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=15279

I heard about this too, do you still have the screenshots?
@aldente: actually I don't agree with you, from making your own stuff you can learn a lot. I'm currently making a 64 bit debugger, can't say its the best now but I can say I learned hundreds of things of it. Obviously my product isn't going to compete with olly or ida, but I like to do things the way I like it with a very select few who agree with my ideas. A big project (let's say for the whole reversing community) can be a good thing, but when it's wild and new everybody just tries to push their ideas into it and eventually it will suck.
Just my two cents
edit: just for the record: I'm not building from ground up, I use TitanEngine for the debugger and BeaEngine for the disassembler part, QT for the GUI soon..

First, it is an x64 target so ollyDbg will not work Wink , you need x64dbg.
did you check if it is packed -if yes you will see that the target has many calls out of the .text section with many anti-debug checks -
what you need ( as I remember) is dll inject and huck some API before you use HW-BP to bypass anti-debug, then you apply ur patches.

java cracking
I have run into interesting program.. its registration algorithms are completely in java, so I used IDA to disassemble a class file named something like ""license_check.class"" and it looks very easy to crack it.. but i did not know java opcodes, so i googled it up here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings
I'm still looking for ""olly"" like debugger for java, capable to do patches on the fly..
Is there anything like that?

A few weeks ago I used the same method; and still prefer patching instead of recompiling that requires installing seldom used bloatware.
DJ (http://www.neshkov.com/dj.html) has bytecode, sourcecode, and hex views, unfortunately those aren't synchronized (like the source/hex views in IDA).

Microsoft is not happy with me sharing the ""cleaned"" or ""truncated"" versions with  all the Spyware and Telemetry modules stripped off from their ISOs Frown
While they did not pay attention to other ""repacked"" versions of Win 10, of which many,many are still available on the warez sites, the MS guys knew that this is what the REAL Windows 10 should look and feel like, minus the bloatware.
Install time of 90 seconds, RAM usage of just 1+ GB, Snappy look and feel, ZERO telemetry, UPDATES permanently OFF,  etc, etc.
Feeling threatened, they decided to DMCA those shares ... Frown
They decided to refer to an obscure statement in their License Terms which prohibits me from ""modifying"" their releases.
I could successfully win my claim that I only ""removed"" some stuff from the x86 ISO, without actual modification of their signed binaries, but for the x64 ISO it was not that easy.
SO I am re-making them Big Grin
So no public shares or mirrors of the ISOs please ...
I do not mind if you guys share privately via PMs etc
If you do share privately, please remember to include all the notes that I included with the ISOs..
Most importantly, my request is : PLEASE do not  discuss illegal activations of those ISOs in public (to avoid getting me into more trouble)...

I already wrote everything clearly here I believe.
Could we please avoid discussing these ISOs in this PUBLIC section of the forum that is visible to all, including the indexing search engines ?
Thank you for your understanding Smilie
@chants: Obviously they DO work. That is why Microsoft is unhappy about it. That is why MS does not care about the many repacks/customized versions  of the Windows installers available from various groups but has decided to target only mine.
Put simply, my releases had been aimed to be Windows XP version of the Windows 10 (you just needed to change the desktop wallpaper to the Windows XP one, Big Grin that was  all).
To make matters worse for MS, I did not add any ""extra"" files into the ISO (and thus ALL the existing files in that distro would validate correctly with SFC /scannow , for example) while at the same time, all the filter drivers that MS put in there to have control of our file system and telemetry (among other activities) have been mercilessly truncated off from the install).
As I'd said earlier in Feb when I released them in this forum, these distros were initially created for my internal use in my company with the sole aim of having a WINDOWS XP version of Windows with the full features and security of Windows 10. A lot of research, time and energy went into the creation of these distros as we needed to preserve the functionality and at the same time make them as sleek as possible, for the purposes of reversing, especially for DRIVER DEBUGGING, for which the existing Win 10 distros were VERY HIGHLY restrictive.
So , my request, please stop this discussion in this section of the forum. Thank you Smilie
P.S (An Update) : 
Now, while  the Microsoft guys agreed I was right that I had not ""pirated"" or otherwise ""cracked"" the  ISOs in any way, I was apparently ""illegally distributing their software without permission"" ..  Haha 
So I am working out a way with my company attorneys (of course, I do not pay them anything extra for just this matter Wink) to look for a ""loophole"" that would enable me to share the distros (the newer modified and refined ones) with all of you soon.
Presently, the lawyers say that if someone downloads from a share on our server that has been ""accidentally"" left open, then ... Big Grin

These are all very,very old and incomplete @chants. Do you really think that all of us here are so stupid that we cannot find these links until and unless you show them to us?
I logged in here after a month just to see what the talk was all about. In every major reversing forum, there is talk of ""some noob by the name of Chants going on a wild rampage in an effort to discredit Techlord in Exetools forum"". Exetools is a highly respected forum. Your actions are just projecting Exetools forum in a bad light to everyone outside.
After logging in here, I was stunned by the posts you made in the past 3 days. You need to take a step back and cool down.It is clear that Techlord is ignoring you. It needs two hands to clap. You cannot possibly fight with someone who is ignoring you. Just accept the fact that you'd been kicked out from his forum and move on with your life.

Dear Sir, the gossip of what people think or should think or might think is off topic and was not at all what I was discussing.  Nonsense like this and people constantly badgering about our kind admin chessgod101 losing face is so stupid that we all can see through the pretexting and neurolinguistics programming tactics.
I'm not sure why this nonsense continues being brought up.  I think in many other forums TechLord is banned period.  But here he is tolerated.  And we all begrudgingly tolerate him though he decided to pick on me so he made an enemy.  But he already has a lot of enemies most who ignore him.  But he cannot really afford to keep playing this game.  And it was a pre-decided tactic that he would kick someone out for no reason or a very dodgy reason at best.  Like any good dictator knows.  But he can pay a price by having an open enemy.  Actions have consequences, and even an old man sometimes must learn.  He is very welcome in his own useless slack space.  And he is welcome here only if he wants to share stuff he paid for.",,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=18785

Nice seeing you added debugger capabilities! I have a few questions if you don't mind Smilie
What is this 'DIA' thing you are talking about to load symbols? Is it open source? I could not find it anywhere (though maybe my search terms were off).
And could you maybe give me some pointers as to how you recognize functions and local variables? Do you scan all instructions and populate a nice graph or do you do a linear scan with some algorithms to detect functions or maybe a combination? I am interested in this because I want to implement some of this in x64dbg Smilie
Another small thing, is the arrow location just 'wrong' or is is placed between instructions for a reason? See this screenshot: http://prntscr.com/6ukf81
On and before I forget it, could you share some insight on how you implemented these python functions? I saw the python libs, but do you have some trick to auto generate the required function definitions or is it all manual work?

it's open source, comes with Visual Studio you should have it in VS path e.g. ""c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\DIA SDK\Samples""

first I scan to find begin and the end of the function (it's not always an easy task) and then just 'walk' the function marking, recording instructions related to stack pointer.

there is no reason, it's calculated based on QFontMetrics lineSpacing. Please change font to get hopefully more accurate position but personally it did not bother me that its a millimeter off.

it's manual work but you could use SWIG if you have a lot of functions.

The first method is to scan each and every function then link them together, but the other method is to analyse the instruction line by line and when you identify a function you check for calls inside of it and then go into that new function (inside of the main function) and then repeat the process. This means that if you had something like :
;function prologue
call xxx
;function epilogue
it would follow the call, identify the function and if it had another function the keep repeating it. In the end it would return back to the main function then continue line by line analysis.
What method do you use for this?

Hi everyone,
I'm a new member (joined about 2 days ago, thanks to Dave_Omirora for the invitation code he extended me), and I wish above all, to one day be able to reverse-engineer any computer application, just as you do here on this forum. To this end, I'd like to solicit the help of the several experts here in guiding me through so that I can achieve this goal.
Even though my background is in telecoms(I have a second degree in telecommunications and currently, an RF engineer), reverse engineering has always fascinated me. I'd really like to be an expert in reverse engineering one day. I'd appreciate all the mentoring I can get from you guys.

The studyes does not have any impact on the RE capacity. The talent and passion does the job.
I myself have two degrees and post degress.....but the passion is always first not the education.

Indeed we see I was only responding to trolls (who hijacked threads and changed the topic such as Megin or Ragnarok) that may very well be multiple accounts as pointed out by a fellow member.  Please do not continue doing the same thing.  I think the rules you were referring to reading was:
Quote:
3. One user with multiple accounts or shared accounts
Ban all accounts.
6. Abuse of [Reputation+1]

Although with the threads deleted and Ragnarok keeping the points for shoulder patting, I suppose its hard to enforce.  Seems like a bug that reputation points are kept on deleted threads.

Just though I might add my own tip for cracking java.
Notice: I know how to program in java (I also know the bytecode of course), and at least some basics are needed even if just for patching an instruction - objects, stack, etc.
Well, since I don't usually run under a debugger (IDA or higher-level), what I do sometimes is have a static look at the code - normally with JD - and find interesting spots. Examples: encrypted strings, strange file accesses, etc. Just by the nature of the java.*.* objects being used, you often get a pretty good idea of what's going on, and those can never be obfuscated like the programmer's code.
Then you need to patch the framework's code itself. ""String"", for instance, is a class you can easily change. Just fetch the java rt sources (it comes with the sdk), copy it to your own version, and for instance in the constructor just do a ""System.out.println(this);"".
Want the stacktrace as well to know where this string was created? Just add another statement with ""new Exception().printStackTrace();"" Big Grin
The only thing left is to make java use your version of the rt classes instead of the original ones. Just add this modifier to the invocation:
java ... -Xbootclasspath/p:my_path\my_jar_with_changed_stuff.jar ...
There you go. All constructed strings (a LOT) will be written to the console, followed by the stack trace of the place they were created.
Extending this technique, I once also did something with the java.lang.Exception class. Changed the source so that every single exception wrote the stack trace to a log (be it the captured ones, the ones that happen during regular class loading, etc.) - creates a huge log but also allows you to know about everything that got raised and might not be even been propagated to error windows or log files.
Since the output is so huge, I later added some logic to it: created a settings file that could be supplied in the command line and where one could create regular expressions for the stack traces to ignore in order to hide ""normal"" exceptions that are raised a lot.
Unfortunately, this was quite some time ago and I no longer have the code at hand. Still it's not hard for someone to do it if needed.",,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=13074&page=2

Use JD Gui to find what youre looking for and eventually JBE to patch, a recursive decompile with JAD and clear text search sometimes helps. JAD decompile can be done with cmd below. If you have multiple jars, just extract everything, then run the decompile.
JAD Recursive Decompile:   for /R %F in (*.class) do jad -r -ff -s java %F
JD Gui - Must have, will allow full exploration of .JAR, as well as export of source.
http://jd.benow.ca/
JBE - Java Bytecode Editor can be used to patch whatever bytecode you desire, modifying the class directly without having to recompile. Will require more than a basic understanding of Java bytecode to use this effectively. 
http://set.ee/jbe/
Once you have the patched .class you can simply just drop it back into the .jar with WinRar, or if you are working on a standalone .class then your basically done.
Hope this helps, patching Java can be interesting, especially ones that have string encryption functions.

I see that the debugger do a analysis like IDA do before starting to debug itself the target.
That analysis is done each time the executable is loaded even is the same and not modified. Can you do a file that keep the analysis and if the CRC change analyse again else is a waste of time to wait each time for the analysis to complete.

Yeah, its stopped I'm working on version2 (actually it's new project but some code is shared with ArkDasm). Advantages over ArkDasm:
cross platform (Win/Linux/Mac)
multi-arch (x86, x64, Arm32, Arm64, MIPS 32)
supported file types: ELF32, ELF64, PE64, raw binary.
RetDec decompiler support (press F5 on a function to get C code just like in IDA)

Eclipse with Bytecode Visualizer in Combination with JD-Eclipse is great. Tho Bytecode Visualizer is not able to set breakpoints in the actual methods. You can only break on method entries. This makes debugging a little more painful.
I usually copy the required decompiled classes to a new project and fix the dependencies. Then you can easily debug with your IDE.

Hi everyone,
A total newbie here. I was trying to find a place to introduce myself and here I come. Smilie I just received an invitation and jumped on it as soon as I got.
I am into computer science and I love hacking, disassembling, decoding and debugging. I'd like to learn how to work with IDA these days.

G'day from Australia!
I am Loopy_Bytes (Loop_DE_Loopz).
I would like to say a great big HELLO to everybody on the EXETOOLS FORUM!!
I have been a viewer of this most awesome information repository for a while now, and when given an opportunity by Dreamer for an invite, I jumped at the chance!
I am here for knowledge, which I believe is a 2 way street.
Although I am still relatively 'fresh' to RE, I have managed to do a few things right..
It is my belief that knowing a little bit of everything, can help you achieve anything!!
I am also having a little bit of trouble with little squares () appearing as text.. Maybe it has something to do with the Chrome translation service, I am not sure. It makes navigation slightly difficult, but no major drama.
Thankyou for reading this, and I do hope that one day, you will read a tutorial of mine, and learn something - as I will, and quite possibly already have, learn from you..

Hey there,
I am Blue, from Team URET/IREC. I am new here and if I've posted in wrong section then kindly forgive me.
I am no more in RCE scene but I can never say good bye to this. It's the place from where I've started learning internals and native coding.
No doubt this scene is a mixture of heaven and hell. Roll Eyes (Sarcastic) On one side there are really some talented and helpful guys but on another side it got those guys who are keeping this scene down. No personal comments, but today I got to know about some guys who are selling cracks. Don't know if this is real issue or just a lame one. But if it's real then?

I wanted to take the time to introduce myself. I am an avid learner and have chosen to take up reverse engineering. I have purchased Reversing the secrets of reverse engineering.

I'm Bey - been programming for a bit more than 30 years. I can remember the time when
I would disassemble programs by hand, i.e., print out the program in hex and go through
it with pen and paper. I program in many languages  but have discarded all languages
based on BASIC. Currently, I program in assembly, C, C++, C#, java - seems like I focus
on the C-based languages. I do a lot of reverse engineering of software (be it Windows
or Linux) but haven't done much in the area of unpacking programs.
I hope that I can contribute to the forum anything new I may learn, and, as I am disabled
and do not work (or leave the house that often!), I spend nearly all waking hour on the
computer doing research as well as programming.

We are good friends of many teams. We share information and advises to each other.
I am sure if one person got banned here, the reason must be that he did something harmful to eXeTools forum or eXeTools members. Not just because power from others.
If you god banned by one moderator/administrator, we trust and respect his decision. That is also a reason why we are very careful on choosing moderators/administrators.",,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=14329&page=12

I just wanted to introduce myself and give an enormous ""thank you"" for the opportunity to be a member here after many years of being an outside observer of the forum. Additionally, I want to say thank you to all of the individuals who have spent so much time and effort making this the best RCE forum on the internet.
Moving on to the introduction... I am a male in my late 20s and I live great in the great, although sadly screwed up at present, nation of the USA. Since I was about 10 years old I have been interested in programming (VB in the earliest days... yuck...), hardware modding (I was that kid that installed modchips in all his friends consoles), building custom gaming rigs, and general computer security. 
In more recent times (roughly last decade or perhaps a little further back), I became much more interested in learning legitimate reversing skills rather than just being another script kiddy (we've all been there... right?). Initially started learning OllyDbg and in more recent years moved on to IDA and WinDbg. On the programming side, I have done serious dabbling in C++ and ASM, but I am by no means proficient in either. The only programming languages I would call myself proficient in are C# and Python (perhaps Ruby too... although not by choice... I had to use Metasploit professionally) which I have used a lot in past and current professions. 
After working in the security industry for years, mostly as a security researcher doing bug hunting and writing exploits, I decided to go back to school and get my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. Since then I have returned to the security industry and have continued my career in that field. 
With all of that out of the way, which I doubt anyone actually cares about or will even read, I mostly just want to say I am happy to be here and be a part of the community. I am an easily approachable person and would be happy to help anyone or share my skills with others who do not have the same skill set as myself. I hope to find others in the community who will help me learn about topics that I don't have a lot of experience in (for example, unpacking has just never been a strong point for me... I definitely need to work on improving my skills in that area). 
Finally, as an initial offering, or rather a show of gratitude for accepting me into your community, I will soon be posting a keygen (including a very well commented source) that I recently wrote (and have not shared with anyone) for a piece of virtualization software that is as-of-now publicly uncracked. As soon as I'm done cleaning up the code I will post it. I will post the Python source which is what I originally wrote it in, plus the C++ binary that I later converted the Python to (I can release the C++ source if anyone wants it... I just thought the Python source would be easier for people to learn from).",,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=14329&page=18

My name is Cryo, and I'm a reverse engineering enthusiast, security researcher, pentester, hobbyist programmer, and animator.
My career as an infosec professional began about a year ago, and I'm currently part of the Incident Response team at a national organization doing blue team stuff. Funny enough, even though my job is almost fully blue team, I've obtained Offensive Security's OSCP and OSCE certifications, the latter of which is what really made me fall in love with reverse engineering and debugging.
As far as programming goes, I mainly work with Python when I need something automated quickly, but I'll use C or ASM if I want to focus on speed and efficiency. Most of my bigger stuff can be found on GitHub under the username KernelEquinox. I'm currently working on mapping out the .SAI file format for Paint Tool SAI files, but I'll also be attempting to create a keygen for it in the near future.
Unfortunately, while I love doing dynamic analysis using OllyDbg and x64dbg, I'm only vaguely familiar with using tools like IDA Pro, but I definitely hope to learn a lot about static analysis and further my knowledge in all other areas! I love both teaching and learning, and while I might be extremely antisocial, I'm hoping that meeting some of you and interacting with the community will help alleviate some of my posting anxiety.

Everything from security engineer, security consultant, security analyst, sysadmin, unix junkie, coder, pen tester - jack of all trades and expert in nothing Wink
I have been involved in the hacking community in Ireland for a long time now. 10+ years with the Dublin 2600 group and I'm one of the founders of Ireland's first ever hackerspace. I attend at least two hacking conferences or camps a year. Although this year I have to work so I'm missing out on 33c3 in Hamburg and I'm quite sad about it! It was 25c3 in Berlin that inspired a group of us to start the hackerspace in Dublin.
I've always had an interest in reverse engineering but never spent enough quality time doing it permanently, that's been changing over the last year though. I've mostly done it in moments of anger and need in the past. Over the last few months I've dove into the open security training material and I'm now moving through the Practical Malware Analysis book. I also have a convenient supply of malware thanks to work which helps.
My focus is mostly on Windows executables and network protocols. I would however like to spend more time on ELF binaries but I find I deal with them mostly when playing CTF competitions.

I recently registered thanks to the open registration and Aaron (thank you!).
I'm currently a student getting a degree in a (computer) related field. Unfortunately I have limited time now due to tests and exams. Frown
I have actually started programming as a kid on a C64 I have found and I still think it's the best thing, because C64 BASIC teaches you assembly (style concepts) without actually teaching you raw assembly.  I'm one of those guys. Smilie
I have past experience with low-level stuff and basic reversing. I have been greatly interested in low-level things since forever. Partially that's where my interest in reversing comes from. Currently my low-level knowledge is a lot better than my practical reversing knowledge/skills. I always liked knowing how stuff works at the core and how it makes the whole thing work.
I currently dabble with electronics too so think of tiny, tiny computers. Smilie

Been lurking around for a little bit, realized that I need to commit more to learning and being involved with others.
Probably on the younger side of most people here, my current interests are .NET, JVM, Python and most processor types. Web reversing is probably going to be my next really big dive, along with any new web DRM.
Looking for a mentor of sorts, someone to tell me good leads and let me figure out the bulk of it.
Also looking for a CTF team to take me in as a intern or student of some kind. Exploiting things is a dream but understanding of how to find exploits with out fuzzing is a bit lacking.
Deeper Code Analysis > de-obfuscation / unpacking.
Black box is always more fun.
Teaching others by hand is worth the time if they pay it forward. Hate just pushing people away because they don't know what to google Frown
Python > any others (Ruby is the exception for puppet)
x64dbg > olly/imudbg
DNSpy > Reflector
IDA > All
WinDbg > better then giving up
Favorite VS plugin: pInvoke
Favorite IDA plugin: IDABuddy
Coolest thing I have taken apart?
Back in highschool the security cameras were web based. Happened to be using silverlight. Download the application locally, extract files, peek in the dlls and there was no ""real"" auth. Never got to use it though Frown Fun adventure for the not much younger but still really new to RE me.
Thanks for reading! Tried to keep the intro colorful to try to inspire some more creative things in the future!

I used to be a member of some very well known scene groups in the '98-01 period back when SoftICE ruled the world and have been doing RE work as a hobby afterwards, as well as on a small-scale professional level since '09. I am currently a software developer, one of the very few (probably) that still has to write some assembler code every now and then.
Sounds like we started reversing at the same time.
What is name of the group? I am curious.",[u'https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?p=113086#post113086'],https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=14329&page=21

Yeah, I completely agree, the only downside was having to take notes on actual paper. I remember having notebooks full of seemingly random addresses.
I figure it wouldn't be impossible to make a similar kernel-level debugger nowadays, but the effort would probably be disproportionately large when compared to the payout so nobody really wants to do it. I'm guessing Compuware discontinued SI because it wasn't particularly lucrative.",[u'https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?p=113249#post113249'],https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=14329&page=21

my name is Manuel and I use the alias bytewolf since about 2010, maybe a few years prior. I'm interested in electronics and programming. I've started programming in Basic on my Breadbin C64 and on PC in Pascal back in the 90's. But now I mostly use C#, because it's convinient and runs on almost all platforms.
Since the beginning I'm interested in reverse engineering, mostly physical reversing, to see how things work. I hope I can learn more about it here and contribute as well.

I'm into computing since I got a C64 at a young age.
I started properly programing using C/C++ around 2001, before than I was using basic, later visual basic or pascal.
Nowadays I mostly develop windows applications using C/C++ and also do some embedded development.

Chuck here. I have always been fascinated by reverse engineering. I first got into modding video game maps when I was 15 or 16 back around 2005 or so. I have a software I use for work and I have wanted to get it working without a dongle for quite awhile now.  About a year ago is when I actually started to sit down and work on it. I have been learning everything I can about hasp dongles. 2 months ago I was successful in using a script and finding the redirected IAT. I then found a guide that showed how to patch the envelope to get hasp to fix the IAT. My software was different but it got me going in the right direction. I am not interested in having someone do this for me. I have been taking my time so I can learn this myself.,,https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=14329&page=21
